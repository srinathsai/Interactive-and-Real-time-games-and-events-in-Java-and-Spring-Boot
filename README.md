## Goal :- </br>
This repository contains all my real time projects  that are coded by me and passed all the test cases of competitions for each project . These competitions tested my Data Structures and Algorithms , problem solving and Spring boot skills in similar to real life scenarios 
conducted as live events.

### Project 1 (Backend Live Project of Blood Donation System) :-
This competiton involved testing the challenges of developing 8 REST APIs of the live Blood donation project.  This project was developed using Spring boot , Java and Object Oriented design involving 4 Jpa Entities , 4 Repository layers and 4 service layers. The db used was MySql for storing the donations, donors, blood bags details and are retrieved from it as well for processing. </br>
**Additionally a feature has been added as well which verfies the validity of user, eligibility of blood donation and quantity required. As a whole with proper front end this project can be utilized in daily life in blood donation camps.** </br>
